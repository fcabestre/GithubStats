# GitStats

This project mini project is aimed at learning `Elixir` and the `OTP` platform. The assigment is quite simple: being able to, given a `Github` user, to retrieve some statistics about it. Here we want its repositories with the count of languages used and the count of contributors for each one. This first iteration involves creation an `escript` to be able to launch the tool from the command line, `Elxir Task`s in order to parallelise requests and some supervision on top of them.

This is just a testbed that should be expended over time as I experiment new language features and idioms.
